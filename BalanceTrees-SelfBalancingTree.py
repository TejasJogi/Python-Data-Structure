# An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

# We define balance factor for each node as :

# balanceFactor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
# The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than âˆ’1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

# You are given a pointer to the root of an AVL tree. You need to insert a value into this tree and perform the necessary rotations to ensure that it remains balanced.

# Input Format

# You are given a function,

# node *insert(node * root,int new_val)
# {


# }
# 'node' is defined as :

# struct node
# {
# int val;            //value
# struct node* left;  //left child
# struct node* right; //right child
# int ht;             //height of the node
# } node;
# You only need to complete the function.

# Note: All the values in the tree will be distinct. Height of a Null node is -1 and the height of the leaf node is 0.


# Output Format

# Insert the new value into the tree and return a pointer to the root of the tree. Ensure that the tree remains balanced.

# Sample Input

#     3
#   /  \
#  2    4
#        \
#         5
# The value to be inserted is 6.

# Sample Output

#     3
#   /  \
#  2    5
#      / \
#     4   6
